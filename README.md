# UFOs
## Overview
The overview of the project was to take a set of data on UFOs sitings and convert them into tables that will then be displayed on a webpage where a user can input filter requirements to find specific data. Essentially, we are creating a dashboard for Dana with a dynamic table to aide her in her research.

## Results
The final result is a webpage where Dana can easily use the filter bar to sort through the dynamic table we created displaying the ufo sitings data.

## Summary
One drawback of this website is that the data is not connected to a live updating source which means that the webpage will become outdated and no longer relavant within a couple of years.

One recomendation I would make would be to pull from a live source to make sure that the dashboard contains all relevant and recent data.

The other recomendation I would make would be to include a click button in the filter so it would be more user friendly.
